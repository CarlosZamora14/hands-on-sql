## Scenario and Goals
On October 23rd, 2021, Kehinde Wiley's infamous painting "Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps" was stolen from the New York City Metropolitan Museum of Art.
The only evidence that the authorities have is a digital evidence file containing flight, bank, cell phone, and other related data. Due to a lack of expertise,
the authorities have been unable to analyze the file to make any headway in the case.

Our task is to analyze the data from the digital evidence file and gather relevant evidence to help us identify the thieves who stole the painting.

## Entity Relationship Diagram
To interact with and execute queries on the database containing information from the digital evidence file, we need to use [The Walter Shields Data Academy SQL Editor](https://wsdalearning.ai/sqleditor/). In the following image, we can observe the structure of the database and the relationships between the different tables. Although there is no clear naming convention and some tables contain duplicate information regarding first and last names, we will utilize this database to crack the case.
